    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Computer Engineer by University Of Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM).
      I have developed cybersecurity projects such as Hack&Win at the UCLM
      and currently developing cybersecurity challenges and machines to practice auditing in real environments
      for the community and in University subjects. I develop content of Twitch, related to cybersecurity.
      I am also starting to collaborate in different private programs in HackerOne to contribute with
      companies increasing their security by reporting bugs. 
      Since I was a little boy I have been passionate about cybersecurity and I have always tried to copy the experts I saw and copied numerous attacks until I started my degree in computer engineering and I began to understand the purpose of the attacks. I have done security audits, both web and internal where I have acquired a lot of knowledge of intrusion and reporting to apply to my day to day.
      I now work as a cloud security engineer managing the vulnerabilities of different entities globally through platforms such as Qualys. My goal and my passion has always been pentesting, is what I spend most of my free hours and I am professionally trained in it, having studied at the university the related specialty and with certifications that prove it.
